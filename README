Poker Enlighter Simulator
=======

Description
-----------------

Poker Enlighter is a freeware poker simulator. It has multiple options for performing a variety of simulations. The program will calculate the percentage of winnings, losses and ties between hands or specific ranges.

The main advantages of Poker Enlighter are:
- It is written in Java, which means it can run on Windows, Mac and Linux machines without any problem.
- It makes use of multi-core CPUs to increase the speed of the simulations. See the Manual for details.
- It has support for more than just Texas Hold'em. Omaha and Omaha Hi/Lo are also supported.

You can find everything about this project on its website: http://pokerenlighter.javafling.org/ .


License

Poker Enlighter Simulator is published under the GPL v3 license, a copy of which is present in the project root.


Usage
-----------------

In order to use the simulator, you have to import the JAR file into your project. You can download it from the Poker Enlighter website.

Within your project, you have to do this:
- Have a class that implements the interface `org.javafling.pokerenlighter.simulation.SimulationNotifiable` .
- Create an object of type `org.javafling.pokerenlighter.simulation.Simulator` and pass to it the class mentioned at the previous point
- Now, while the simulator is running, it will notify your `SimulationNotifiable` object of any events that occur during simulation by calling the methods present in the interface.
- You can see a complete and functioning example (SSCCE) on how to do all this in the `use-example/Example.java` file.
- You can also read through the Javadocs to get a better sense on how the simulator can be used.
- This same information can be found on the Developer Guide section of the website: http://pokerenlighter.javafling.org/developers.php .
